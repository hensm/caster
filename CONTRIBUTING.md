# Contributing

Contributions welcome.

Implementation notes are at [IMPLEMENTATION.md](IMPLEMENTATION.md). 
If you're unsure about anything, feel free to ask.

Just submit a PR for small changes (bugfixes, typos, etc...). Comment first on existing 
issues if you're going to work on something to avoid duplication of effort.

Submit an issue for new features before submitting a PR.


## Compatibility Reports

Compatibility reports are always helpful. Use the "Compatibility Report" issue template. Ensure you have a working environment and that the site is in the whitelist (check options page).


## Localizations

Either fork and edit the messages files manually or to easily add/edit localizations, use the web-ext-translator tool:
